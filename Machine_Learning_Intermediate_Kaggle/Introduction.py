# You will work with data from the Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn 
# Users to predict home prices in Iowa using 79 explanatory variables describing 
# (almost) every aspect of the homes.

# Run the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation features 
# in X_train and X_valid, along with the prediction targets in y_train and y_valid. 
# The test features are loaded in X_test. (If you need to review features and prediction targets,
#  please check out this short tutorial. To read about model validation, look here. 
# Alternatively, if you'd prefer to look through a full course to review all of these topics, start here.)
